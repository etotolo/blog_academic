      <description>Last week the IMF discontinued its $1.5 bil standby credit facility to Kenya. Although the Kenyan government maintained that the economy is solid and it no longer needs the facility, it is more likely that the government would actually benefit from it, especially at a time when emerging markets are volatile, but did not agree with the IMF’s condition to remove the interest rate cap. Since September 2016, Kenyan banks can lend at a maximum of 4% above the key lending rate.</description>
