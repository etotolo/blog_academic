But exactly how big is the market? Who’s using digital credit? And what impact is it having on low-income customers? FSD-Kenya, in partnership with the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK), Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) and CGAP conducted a nationally representative phone survey with over 3,000 Kenyans to find out. The findings suggest that digital credit has become a leading source of credit in Kenya and that it is mostly used to finance working capital and day-to-day consumption needs. But it also suggests many borrowers are struggling to repay. Here are some key takeaways.","tags":["Fintech","Fintech revolution"],"title":"The Digital Credit Revolution in Kenya: An Assessment of Market Demand, 5 Years On","type":"publication"},{"authors":["E Totolo","F Gwer","J Odero"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1509483600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1509483600,"objectID":"c817a0b56a1d12952e59bb1ddbf588b6","permalink":"/publication/price-being-banked/","publishdate":"2017-11-01T00:00:00+03:00","relpermalink":"/publication/price-being-banked/","section":"publication","summary":"This report outlines the findings from a two-year study by FSD Kenya to understand the costs for banking services in Kenya. Two rounds of mystery shopping surveys were completed in October and November of 2015 and 2016 to build a database and measure the costs for basic bundles of transactions such as opening, running and closing bank accounts.While conducting the study, however, it became clear that bank pricing data is difficult to obtain and that market information is still opaque. Although banks are required by the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) to publish “tariff guides” with all their fees and charges, we found that many were either outdated, incomplete or lacking account specific information. There are, however, exemplary banks with up-to-date and accessible tariff guides.This report has three objectives: 1. To assess price transparency 2. To develop affordability indicators that measure the cost of basic bank transactions such as opening and closing bank accounts, withdrawing and transferring money. 3. To identify actionable recommendations solutions as well as government policies aimed and affordability.","tags":["Regulation"],"title":"The price of being banked","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461704400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461704400,"objectID":"122685e3f24e9fc0421e976206fe8b6e","permalink":"/project/fintech-revolution/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00+03:00","relpermalink":"/project/fintech-revolution/","section":"project","summary":"Fintechs are at the core of financial innovation.

However, we still know little about their role in enterprise finance, protection of property rights and regulation of market activity. This chapter focuses in particular on the financial dimension of informality. Through a literature survey and an analysis of a sample of 185 micro and small enterprises operating in a low-income neighborhood in Nairobi, the chapter seeks to describe the range of formal and informal institutions used by entrepreneurs in their market activity. It shows that informal financial networks are more important for highly informal firms, but rarely in their start-up phase. The gender dimension in the use of financial instruments is also explored.","tags":["SME finance"],"title":"Exploring the Black-Box of Economic Informality: Social Networks and Institutional Change among Micro and Small Enterprises in Nairobi, Kenya","type":"publication"}]
