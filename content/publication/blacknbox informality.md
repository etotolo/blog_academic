abstract = "There is growing interest among academics and policy-makers in understanding the role of social networks and informal institutions in shaping market structures in local economies in Africa. However, we still know little about their role in enterprise finance, protection of property rights and regulation of market activity. This chapter focuses in particular on the financial dimension of informality. Through a literature survey and an analysis of a sample of 185 micro and small enterprises operating in a low-income neighborhood in Nairobi, the chapter seeks to describe the range of formal and informal institutions used by entrepreneurs in their market activity. It shows that informal financial networks are more important for highly informal firms, but rarely in their start-up phase. The gender dimension in the use of financial instruments is also explored."
