      <description>Last week the IMF discontinued its $1.5 bil standby credit facility to Kenya. Both the Kenyan government and the IMF said that the economy is solid and it no longer needs the facility. However, the government would obviously benefit from it, especially at a time when emerging markets are volatile, but the two institutions did not reach an agreement about government deficit and the removoval of the interest rate cap. Since September 2016, Kenyan banks can lend at a maximum of 4% above the key lending rate.</description>
