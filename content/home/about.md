# Biography

I am a research economist at FSD Kenya, specializing in inclusive finance, development economics and private sector development. This website is a space for data insights and analytics, and to reflect (i.e. rant) about what is happening in the Kenyan economy. Views are f course my own, not necessarily those of my employer.
