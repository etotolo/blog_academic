      <description>A long-term analysis of the Kenyan Shilling (KES) against the US Dollar (USD) leaves no doubt that the Kenyan Shilling has depreciated in the last 20 years, although it has stabilized in the last 3 years. Kenya actively implemented several economic reform measures (pdf) since the 1990s inclusing a liberalization of interest rates (1990) and the exchange rate (1992/93).
The reason for this decline is fairly simple: Kenya imports too much and exports too little.</description>
