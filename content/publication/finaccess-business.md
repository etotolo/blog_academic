abstract = "FinAccess Business is a research project conducted jointly by FSD-Kenya, the World Bank, and the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) to improve understanding of the SME market on both the supply and demand sides. The study provides a comprehensive trend analysis on the supply of SME finance in Kenya between 2009 and 2013. In addition to quantifying the size of the market and its growth rate, it shows the exposure of different types of banks in the segment, the portfolio of services most used by SMEs, and the quality of assets. The report also discusses the regulatory framework for SME finance, the drivers and obstacles of banksâ€™ involvement with SMEs, and their specific business models."
